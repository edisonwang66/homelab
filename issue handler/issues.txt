that’s correct. It’s very hard to replicate this issue as it doesn’t happen often and not everyone experience this problem, so I won’t be opening a ticket to Aruba unless it really becomes something that cause issues to larger groups. I’m aware that this is happening and it’s good that people provide the feedback, but aside of that, there is no much we can do more than asking to follow that same procedure you explained above

Hi Brian, thanks for reaching out.  None of our network equipment is currently alarming for temperature.


const plantNeedsWater = day => day === 'Wednesday' ? true : false;

const clothingBtn = $w('#clothingButton');

clothingBtn.onClick((event) => {
  // The code below hides the button
  clothingBtn.hide();
});
$w.onReady(function () {
  const clothingBtn = $w('#clothingButton');
  clothingBtn.show();
});

$w.onReady(function () {
  const clothingBtn = $w('#clothingButton');

  clothingBtn.onClick( (event) => {
    // The code below fades out the button
    const fadeOptions = {
      duration: 1000,  // how long to play the animation in milliseconds
      delay: 250  // how long to wait before playing the animation in milliseconds
    };

    clothingBtn.hide('fade', fadeOptions);
  });
});

.hide() to hide Wix elements
.show() to show Wix elements
.onClick() to listen for clicks on a mouse
.onMouseIn() to listen for a mouse pointer entering an element
.onMouseOut() to listen for a mouse pointer leaving an element
.onDblClick(), a method that listens for double clicks on any element.
.scrollTo() , a method that adds animation to scroll to an element.

currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];   Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) will give us a random number from 0 to 3. 


JS Asynchronous
const executorFunction = (resolve, reject) => {
  if (someCondition) {
      resolve('I resolved!');
  } else {
      reject('I rejected!'); 
  }
}
const myFirstPromise = new Promise(executorFunction);

Let’s break down what’s happening above:

We declare a variable myFirstPromise
myFirstPromise is constructed using new Promise() which is the Promise constructor method.
executorFunction() is passed to the constructor and has two functions as parameters: resolve and reject.
If someCondition evaluates to true, we invoke resolve() with the string 'I resolved!'
If not, we invoke reject() with the string 'I rejected!'
