<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field">
</form>

The action attribute determines where the information is sent.
The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.
It’s also important that we include a name attribute for the <input> — without the name attribute, information in the <input> won’t be sent when the <form> is submitted.
