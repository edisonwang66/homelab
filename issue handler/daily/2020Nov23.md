What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that allows programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.

The DOM is one of the better-named acronyms in the field of Web Development. In fact, a useful way to understand what DOM does is by breaking down the acronym but out of order:

The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web page’s HTML Document as an Object.
Note: There are other types of documents, such as XML and SVG, that are also modeled as DOM structures.

The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.

For this reason, we like to think of the DOM as the link between an HTML web page and scripting languages.


In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. The descendants of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag followed by the <head> and <body> tags and so on.

Nodes and Elements in the DOM
As mentioned, a node is the equivalent of each family member in a family tree. A node is an intersecting point in a tree that also contains data.

There are nine different types of node objects in the DOM tree. In our diagram, the node objects with the sharp-edge rectangles are of the type Element, while the rounded edge rectangles are of type Text, because they represent the text inside the HTML paragraph elements.

When trying to modify a web page, the script will mostly interact with the DOM nodes of type element. Elements are the building units of HTML web pages, they contain everything between an opening tag and a closing tag. If the tag is a self-closing tag, then that is the element itself.

Attributes of Element Node
DOM element nodes model elements in an HTML document.

Much like an element in an HTML page, the DOM allows us to access a node’s attributes, such as its class, id, and inline style.

In the diagram to the right, we have highlighted the paragraph element with an id of “bio” in the HTML document. If we were accessing that element node in our script, the DOM would allow us to tweak each of those attributes, or simply access them to check their value in the code.

The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that organizes the elements on a web page and allows scripting languages to access them. This lesson will focus on some of the most useful methods and properties of the DOM Interface in JavaScript. This interface is implemented by every modern browser.

First things first! The document object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure. The document allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree. Before you can access a specific element in the page, first you must access the document structure itself. The document allows scripts to access children of the DOM as properties.

For example, if you wanted to access the <body> element in your script, you could access it as a property of the document by typing document.body. This property will return the body element of that DOM.

Similarly, you could access the <title> element with the .title property. See a comprehensive list of all document properties.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document
  
 
document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';
document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; 
<html>	
	<head>
		<title>The title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>The heading</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				A description
			</p>
			<p id="bio" style="color:blue">
				A summary
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
  		<script src="./main.js"></script>
</html>

The following code would return the first paragraph in the document.
**document.querySelector('p');**

The example chains so that it selects the element with an ID of ‘bio’ and set its .innerHTML to the text ‘The description’.
**document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';**

document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML='Most popular TV show searches in 2016.'

document.getElementById('fourth').innerHTML='Fourth element'

<html>	
	<head>
		<title>Popular Google Searches</title>
	</head>

	<body>
    <h1>Top 5 most popular global searches in 2017</h1>
    <ol>
      <li id="first">Hurricane Irma</li>
      <li id="second">iPhone 8</li>
      <li id="third">iPhone X</li>
      <li id="fourth">Matt Lauer</li>
      <li id="fifth">Meghan Markle</li>
		</ol> 
    
	</body>

  		<script src="./main.js"></script>
</html>


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference
For example, the following code selects the first element with a class of blue and assigns blue as the background-color:

let blueElement = document.querySelector('.blue');
blueElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
Unlike CSS, the DOM style property does not implement a hyphen such as background-color, but rather camel case notation backgroundColor. Check out this MDN reference page to see a list of how CSS properties are converted into JavaScript.

The following chaining syntax would also work:

document.querySelector('.blue').style.fontFamily = 'Roboto';

    <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
    <h2>The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
    <p>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across the US. This year, 3 million kids
      played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
    <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not chump change. And those advertisers,
      like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. </p>
    <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in soccer across the country for years to come. </p>

The following code creates a new paragraph element, gives it an id, adds text to the new element’s .innerHTML, and appends it to the body of the document:

let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
 
paragraph.id = 'info'; 
 
paragraph.innerHTML = 'The text inside the paragraph';
 
document.body.appendChild(paragraph);


let newDestination = document.createElement('li');
newDestination.id = 'oaxaca';
newDestination.innerHTML = 'Oaxaca, Mexico';
document.getElementById('more-destinations').appendChild(newDestination);




Remove an Element
Select the element with the ID oaxaca and save it to a variable.
Select its parent, assigned an ID of more-destinations.
const parent = document.querySelector("#more-destinations");

const child = document.querySelector("#oaxaca");

parent.removeChild(child);
Remove the element using the .removeChild() method and passing in the variable containing the oaxaca element.


**Interactivity with onclick**
The .onclick property allows you to assign a function to run on a click event on an element:

let element = document.getElementById('interact');
element.onclick = function() { element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue' };


let element = document.querySelector("button");

function turnButtonRed (){
	element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
  element.style.color = "white";
  element.innerHTML = "Red Button"; 
}



let first = document.body.firstChild;
first.innerHTML = 'I am the child!'
first.parentNode.innerHTML = 'I am the parent and my inner HTML has been replaced!'
all body changed to this sentence.

element.onclick = turnButtonRed;

Review
In this lesson, you manipulated a webpage structure by leveraging the Document Object Model interface in JavaScript.

Let’s review what we learned:

The document keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript
The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the .querySelector() method
You can also access an element directly by its ID with .getElementById()
The .innerHTML and .style properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively
You can create, append, and remove elements by using the .createElement(),.appendChild() and .removeChild() methods respectively
The .onclick property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event



Event Handler
let eventTarget = document.getElementById('targetElement');
 
eventTarget.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // this block of code will run when click event happens on eventTarget element
});

let readMore = document.getElementById('read-more');
let moreInfo = document.getElementById('more-info');

// Write your code here:
function showInfo() {
  moreInfo.style.display = 'block';
}

readMore.addEventListener('click', showInfo);

another way: eventTarget.onclick = eventHandlerFunction;
