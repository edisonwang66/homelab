What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that allows programmers to conceptualize hierarchy and access the elements on a web page.

The DOM is one of the better-named acronyms in the field of Web Development. In fact, a useful way to understand what DOM does is by breaking down the acronym but out of order:

The DOM is a logical tree-like Model that organizes a web page’s HTML Document as an Object.
Note: There are other types of documents, such as XML and SVG, that are also modeled as DOM structures.

The DOM is a language-agnostic structure implemented by browsers to allow for web scripting languages, like JavaScript, to access, modify, and update the structure of an HTML web page in an organized way.

For this reason, we like to think of the DOM as the link between an HTML web page and scripting languages.


In the DOM tree, the top-most node is called the root node, and it represents the HTML document. The descendants of the root node are the HTML tags in the document, starting with the <html> tag followed by the <head> and <body> tags and so on.

Nodes and Elements in the DOM
As mentioned, a node is the equivalent of each family member in a family tree. A node is an intersecting point in a tree that also contains data.

There are nine different types of node objects in the DOM tree. In our diagram, the node objects with the sharp-edge rectangles are of the type Element, while the rounded edge rectangles are of type Text, because they represent the text inside the HTML paragraph elements.

When trying to modify a web page, the script will mostly interact with the DOM nodes of type element. Elements are the building units of HTML web pages, they contain everything between an opening tag and a closing tag. If the tag is a self-closing tag, then that is the element itself.

Attributes of Element Node
DOM element nodes model elements in an HTML document.

Much like an element in an HTML page, the DOM allows us to access a node’s attributes, such as its class, id, and inline style.

In the diagram to the right, we have highlighted the paragraph element with an id of “bio” in the HTML document. If we were accessing that element node in our script, the DOM would allow us to tweak each of those attributes, or simply access them to check their value in the code.

The Document Object Model, abbreviated DOM, is a powerful tree-like structure that organizes the elements on a web page and allows scripting languages to access them. This lesson will focus on some of the most useful methods and properties of the DOM Interface in JavaScript. This interface is implemented by every modern browser.

First things first! The document object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure. The document allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree. Before you can access a specific element in the page, first you must access the document structure itself. The document allows scripts to access children of the DOM as properties.

For example, if you wanted to access the <body> element in your script, you could access it as a property of the document by typing document.body. This property will return the body element of that DOM.

Similarly, you could access the <title> element with the .title property. See a comprehensive list of all document properties.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document
  
 
document.body.innerHTML = 'The cat loves the dog.';
document.body.innerHTML = '<h2>This is a heading</h2>'; 
<html>	
	<head>
		<title>The title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>The heading</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				A description
			</p>
			<p id="bio" style="color:blue">
				A summary
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
  		<script src="./main.js"></script>
</html>

The following code would return the first paragraph in the document.
**document.querySelector('p');**

The example chains so that it selects the element with an ID of ‘bio’ and set its .innerHTML to the text ‘The description’.
**document.getElementById('bio').innerHTML = 'The description';**

document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML='Most popular TV show searches in 2016.'

document.getElementById('fourth').innerHTML='Fourth element'

<html>	
	<head>
		<title>Popular Google Searches</title>
	</head>

	<body>
    <h1>Top 5 most popular global searches in 2017</h1>
    <ol>
      <li id="first">Hurricane Irma</li>
      <li id="second">iPhone 8</li>
      <li id="third">iPhone X</li>
      <li id="fourth">Matt Lauer</li>
      <li id="fifth">Meghan Markle</li>
		</ol> 
    
	</body>

  		<script src="./main.js"></script>
</html>
